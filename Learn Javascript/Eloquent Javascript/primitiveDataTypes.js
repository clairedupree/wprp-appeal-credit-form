//computers can only read, modify, or create new data
//modern computers have over 30 billion bits in volatile memory
//hard drive storage has magnitudes more

//data types are called VALUES
//create a value with name alone

//NUMBER value = numeric values
//integers and decimals
    //64 bits

//OPERATORS 
//precedence: ( )    / * %    + -

//SPECIAL VALUES
//Infinity and -Infinity: pos and neg infinities, not mathematically sound
//NaN: "not a number" can be numeric value but nonmeaningful ones, ex: 0/0 or Infinity-Infinity

//STRING value = text
//'single' or "double" quotes or `backticks`

//SPECIAL CHARACTERS
// \n newline
    //can be used without escape character with `backtick` strings
// \" quote symbol
// \t tab

//"concatenate" + "strings" + "with" + "+"
//strings have associated methods
//TEMPLATE LITERALS: backtick-quoted string
//usually called template literals, can do a few more tricks. Apart from being able to span lines, they can also embed other values.

//typeof returns a string naming the data type
console.log(typeof 8)
console.log(typeof "bob")
